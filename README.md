# The Verge Headline Scraper üì∞
This is a Python script that scrapes headlines, URLs, authors, and dates of articles from theverge.com and saves them to a CSV file and SQLite database.
The script is designed to be run on a cloud service like AWS and can be set up with a cronjob to run daily.

pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py
```

## Output
The script will generate a CSV file titled ddmmyyy_verge.csv with the following headers: id, URL, headline, author, and date. The script will also create an SQLite database and store the same data in a table with the same column names. The id column is set as the primary key to ensure that there are no duplicate entries.

```bash
0 0 * * * TZ=Asia/Kolkata /usr/bin/python3 /home/ubuntu/theverge/run.py
```

This will run the script at midnight every day.
